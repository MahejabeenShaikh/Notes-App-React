# Notes-App-React
In this Repository I built a notes app using React and localStorage. My app has all the required functionalities, for example, storing a user input, saving it, and deleting it. I used localStorage to persist the data to browser. Therefore, it will not lost when we refresh the page. I even went a step further to add a character count and a progress bar so the user knows how much space they have left to type.
